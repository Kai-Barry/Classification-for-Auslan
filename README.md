## About

Throughout the thesis, various machine learning models and techniques are explored and compared to identify the most effective and accurate methods for classifying the location and movement parameters in Auslan signing. The aim is to develop a robust and efficient system that can accurately interpret and recognize the subtle nuances of sign language, enhancing communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
